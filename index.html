<h3><a class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>
<p>The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is Chrome sponsoring this?</h3>
<p>The Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does this change things?</h3>
<p>Once any smart device can have a web address, the entire overhead of an app seems a bit backward. The Physical Web approach unlocks tiny use cases that would never be practical:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bus stop tells you the next bus arrival</li>
<li>Parking meters and vending machines all work the same way, letting you pay quickly and easily</li>
<li>Any store, no matter how small, can offer an online experience when you walk in</li>
<li>A ZipCar broadcasts a signup page, allowing you to immediately drive away</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples are about little bits of data and very simple interactivity. Sometimes it's the tiny ideas that can change the world.</p>
