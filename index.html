<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>The Physical Web is an open source approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.</p>

<p>We're developing it out in the open as we do all things related to the web. While Google is creating <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2016/02/the-physical-web-expands-to-chrome-for_10.html">an initial implementation</a>, we hope others join in as well.</p>

<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.</p>


<h3>How does this change things?</h3>
<p>Once any smart device can have a web address, the overhead of a dedicated app is no longer required for simple interactions. The Physical Web approach unlocks use cases that would never be practical if a dedicated app were required:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cat collar can let you call to find the owner</li>
<li>A bus can tell you its next stop</li>
<li>A parking meter can let you pay using your phone and the cloud</li>
<li>Any store, no matter how small, can offer an online experience when you walk in</li>
<li>A shared car service can broadcast a signup page, allowing you to immediately drive away</li>
<li>Industrial equipment can offer diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these examples, taken by itself, is modestly useful. Taken as a whole, however, they imply a vast "long tail" where anything can offer information and utility.</p>
<p>So many people ask what is the ‘killer app’ for the Physical Web. That’s a bit like asking what is the killer app for the web itself. When any place and object can offer a web page for help, information, configuration, or use, we’ll unlock millions of things, rather than a single killer product.</p>

<h3>What can you build?</h3>
<p>This <a href="http://google.github.io/physical-web/cookbook/">Cookbook article</a> shows a wide range of experiences that can be built using the Physical Web.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>A small utility on the phone scans for URLs that are nearby. We are  using the open <a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone">Eddystone-URL</a> Bluetooth beacon format to find nearby URLs without requiring any centralized registrar. Here is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/">list of many beacon makers</a> that are already supporting Eddystone. We also support finding URLs through Wifi using mDNS and uPnP.</p>
